# Crossword-Puzzle-ALGO The crosswordPuzzle function fills the crossword grid by placing each given word either horizontally or vertically where it fits.
It uses backtracking, meaning it tries a word in every possible position, and if it doesnâ€™t work, it removes it and tries another arrangement until the puzzle is completely solved.
